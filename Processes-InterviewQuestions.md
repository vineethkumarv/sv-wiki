**1.Difference between fork_join,fork_join_any and fork_join_none ?**
|   **fork_join**  |          **fork_join_any**                         |                    **fok_join_none**                |                    
|:---------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------|
|In fork_join the main(parent) threads will execute after all the threads(child threads) in the fork_join is executed|In fork_join_any the main(parent) threads executes if any one of the child threads excecutes | In fork_join_none child threads and main(parent) threads are executed parallely |

**2.Can we use wait_fork in fork_join ?**

We know that in fork_join  the main thread is executed only when all the threads in fork_join is executed so here no need of using wait_fork.
We can use wait fork after the fork_join_any or fork_join_none  statement to wait for all the threads in the fork-join_any or fork_join_none to complete.
So here in fork_join wait_fork is not required.

**3.Difference between Blocking and Non-Blocking Assignments ?**
|**blocking** |**Non-Blocking** |
|:-------------|:----------------|
|In Blocking Assignment one statement is executed then the next statement will executed i.e first expression of right hand side is evaluated and immediately assigned to the left hand side variable|In Non-Blocking assignment evaluated all the right hand side expression for the current time unit and assigned to left-hand side variable at the end of the time unit|
|Represented by  " *=* "|Represented by " <= "|
|It executes sequentially |It executes parallely|
|Blocking is used in combinational|Non-Blocking is used in sequential|

**4.Difference between wait event and @ event ?**

If we triggered wait and @ in the same delay then wait statement is executed because the wait catches fast then @ event.

**Example:**

    module tb;  
      event e;  
     initial begin  
       #20 ->e;  
       $display($time,"thread1");  
       end  
      initial   
        begin  
         #20 @e;  
         $display($time,"thread2");  
        end  
      initial   
       begin  
       #20 wait(e.triggered);  
       $display($time,"thread3");  
       end 
    endmodule   

In the above example we can see that we have same delay for the event,wait and @ but after executing the event wait is executed eventhough we declared '@' in between, its because wait catches the fast then the @ so as a output we can only see thread1 and thread3.
