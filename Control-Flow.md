# Control flow

In this topic , we will learn about the conditional statements and loops .

## Conditional Statement 
Conditional statement  are used for executing the statements by giving the conditions. These statements until the condition become false . 
There are various types of conditional statements - 
### if 
 This statement is use for giving a single condition and   inside it executing the multiple statements or single statement . This is generally use for comparison of a number or two numbers .
**Syntax** - 
              if(condition)begin
             statements;
             end

### if else

This statement , first the compiler goes to the if condition and checks the condition and execute it if it is true  or if "if" condition is not true , the compiler will go to the "else" statement and checks the condition either it is true or not . If the "if" or "else" any one of them is not true , then the compiler show the error .

**Syntax** - 
             if(condition)begin
              statements;
              end 
             else begin 
             Statements;
             end

### if else ladder 

This statement is use by giving the multiple conditional statements . These statements are 'if elseif elseif .... else' . First the compiler checks the 'if 'condition and execute it if it is true  or if it is false, it will jump to the elseif condition and execute and soo on , at last it will come to else condition . 

**Syntax** - if(condition)begin
             Statements;
              end 
             elseif (condition)begin
              Statements;
              end
              elseif(condition)begin
              Statements;
              end 
               ...
               ...
              else begin 
              Statements;
               end

## Loops 

The loops has a sequence of instructions , it will execute when the instruction is true and execute until the condition of loops will not false . When the condition become false , the loops will terminate . 
There are various kinds of loops  - 
**Pictures of loops**

### 1. for 
for loop, execute the statements multiple times until the statement become false . Execution of "for loop" require three steps -

a. Initialization - It will firstly initialize the variable .
b. condition -  give condition to the loops . It will decide the purpose of the loop.
c. modifier - means in this part , the increment or decrement done .

**Syntax** - for (initialization; condition; modifier) begin
             Statements;
            end
