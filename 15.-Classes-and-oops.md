# Class  
Class is user define data type. Classes contains a set of **"properties"** and **"methods"** in it. Both properties and methods are treated as Members of the class.  
Properties are nothing but variables and methods are nothing but Functions/Tasks. Class declaration does not occupy any memory. we can define a class in systemverilog inside a module or outside of a module.  

## Class decleration syntax:-  
```
class class_name;
   // declare class properties
   // define class method (task and function)
endclass
```
