# Constraint  
The constraint is the way to assign legal value to the random variables. Constraints help us to limit the randomness of the variable by specifying the range. The way to create valid test configurations is by the use of constraints.  
 
To enable the randomization we use rand() and randc() function. 
For using the constraint first, we need to assign the random variables by using the keyword rand or randc. After that declare the constraint statement.  

All the constraint blocks are active at the same time.   
* **Syntax**    
`constraint  constraint_name{random_variable[range];}  `

**Note**-  If the variable is randomised without any constraints, then any value in the range will be assigned to the variable with equal probability. 
***
  Randomization is done in two ways.  
1. Random function system
2. Random Variables 


***
 

## 1.Random Function system  
This system function is used to give the pseudorandom numbers.  These functions are used inside the "initial begin" block. There are generally two system functions used and these are -
|$urandom()|$random()|$urandom_range()|
|:---------|:---------|:---------------|
|Return 32-bit unsigned random number but the number remains the same throughout the simulation unless we change the seed number. For the particular seed number again the random number is fixed and does not change throughout the simulation. Syntax- $urandom()  | Returns 32-bit signed random number and same as $urandom() not change the value throughout the simulation unless the seed number changed. Syntax- $random()| Returns the unsigned value for the given specified range and does not change the value throughout the simulation time.  Syntax - $urandom(max,min);|

 
* **Example -**  
 The below example shows the random function code.   

      a = $random();  
      b = $urandom();  
      c= $urandom_range(4,2); //GIVING RANGE (MAX,MIN)  
      d = $random(23); // assign some seed value  
      e = $urandom(4); // assign seed value  
      $display ("a=$random()      // Return 32 bit signed random variable");  
      $display("Random Value of a  =  %0d",a);    
      $display("b = $urandom()   // Return 32 bit unsigned random value .");    
      $display("Random Value of b = %0d",b);  
      $display ("c = $random_range(4,2)   // Return the unsigned random number") ;    
      $display("                          by giving the range to the variable");  
      $display("Random value of c = %0d",c);  
      $display(" $random(seed);     // assign some seed value, it will display 32 bit ");  
      $display ("                         signed random value for the given seed value ");  
      $display ("d = $random(23);  // Seed value =23");  
      $display ("Random value of d = %0d",d );  
      $display ("$urandom(seed);  // assign the seed value , it will display 32 bit ");  
      $display ("                    unsigned random value for the given seed value ");     
      $display ("e = $urandom(4);  // Seed value = 4;");  
      $display ("Random value of e = %0d", e);  
      end

## 2.Random Variables 
Generally, a random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes. 
The class variables which get random values on randomization are called random variables. The value of the random variable is uniformly distributed for the range. 
 
**Purpose of random variables** 
When we do direct tests, we need some time to think about the possible conditions or scenarios for the test and there is a possibility that we missed some test cases. To solve this random variable concept is introduced.  
In a random variable, random values in that particular assigned range will be generated.  
_The drawback of random functions is, that they cannot change the value throughout the simulation times ._ 


 To use, random variables, class variables need to be declared using the rand and randc type-modifier keywords.  

### rand 
rand is non-cyclic in nature. It will randomly give any value and can repeat the value before completing the cycle.  
* **Syntax**  
`rand data_type variable_name;`
  

* **Example**  

The below example is of rand variable.  

      class rand_function;  
         rand logic [2:0] a ; 
      endclass  
      rand_function raf;  
        module rand_var;  
        initial begin  
        //  rand_function ra_f;  
        raf = new();  
       $display ("rand - Randomizing the value of the variable in the non-cycling form  ");  
       for (int i =0;i <= 10;i++)begin  
       void'(raf.randomize ());  
        $display("Iteration = %0d Random value of a = %0d",i, raf.a);  
       end  
      end  
   
In the above code, the class is declared as rand_function inside it the variable declared is 'a '. random variable rand is used to randomize the value of the variable 'a'. Inside the module to randomize the class, randomize() function is used. for loop is used to get the randomised value of the variable 11 times.

### randc  
randc is random cyclic and cycles through all the values within their range before repeating any particular value.
randc is cyclic in nature. It will give a random value and repeat it after completing the cycle.  

* **Syntax**  
`randc data_type variable_name;    `

* **Example**     

The below example is for randc variable.  
  
      class pack;  
        randc bit [2:0]a;  
      endclass  
      module randc_var;  
      pack pk=new();  
       initial begin  
        $display (" randc - It  is cyclic in nature . It will repeat ");  
        $display ("         it's value after completing one cycle .");     
       for (int i =0; i<=12;i++)begin  
       void'(pk.randomize ());  
        $display("Iteration =  %0d    Random Value =  %0d ", i ,pk.a);  
      end  
      end  

 Above code, the class declared is pack inside class variable declared is a. Using the randc, variable a is randomized. Inside module, randomize () is used to randomize the class and for loop is iterating from 0 to 12.

***
## Constraint Block 
Constraint blocks are the class methods just like function and task. Constraints have a unique name in the class.  

* **Syntax**  
  
`constraint [const_name] {expression 1; expression 2; ... expression N}  `
  
Instead of begin end block, constraint blocks are enclosed with curly braces.  
* **Conflict in constraint**    
Conflict in constraint blocks are arise when -  
1. We declare more than one constraint with the same name.
2. If there is non-matching in the given ranges of constraint.  

We can declare constraints inside and outside of the class. For declaring the constraint outside the class, use the "extern" keyword.  
   
**Declare the constraint outside the class block**  

![Untitled Diagram drawio (20)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110443268/187884562-6e352c45-615b-4932-93d1-46d00eec0285.png)


If we declare constraint without using the extern keyword, then it will display a warning while compiling.  
  
  * Declare constraints outside the class-  
* **Syntax**  
`class class_name;  `  
`extern constraint constraint_name;`  
`endclass`  
`constraint class_name ::constraint_name{condition;}`  
  
* **Example**  

The below example will show the constraint declaration with the use of the extern keyword. Here, there are two constraints declared that is b and y. b is declared inside the class and y is declared outside the class using the extern keyword.

      class class_a;  
      rand byte a;  
      rand byte x;  
      constraint b{a<6;  
                   a>2;}  
      extern constraint y;  
      endclass  
      constraint class_a:: y{x>7;}  
      module mod;  
      class_a pack;  
      initial begin  
      pack = new;  
      for (int i =0;i<=5;i++)begin  
      void'(pack.randomize());  
      $display ( "Iteration = %0d  Value of a = %0d Value of x = %0d  " , i,pack.a,pack.x);  
      end  
      end

## Array Randomization  
Randomization can also be done in array data types like static array, dynamic array and queues. The variables have to be declared with the type rand or randc to enable the randomization of the variable.  


### Static array randomization 
  
In a static array, randomization is possible only for the array elements. As the size is fixed, it is not possible to change it.  
Declare the array as the keyword rand or randc; on randomization, the elements of the array will get random values.

* **Example -1**  
The below example show the randomization of the one-dimensional static array without using the constraint.  

       class static_array;  
       randc byte  a[5];  
       endclass  
       module stat_array;  
       static_array stat_arr;  
       initial begin  
       stat_arr = new();  
       $display ("Static array - Size is already declared. So, we can only randomize ");  
       $display ("               the elements of it . ");  
       $display ("Before randomize the elements of array 'a'");  
       $display ("Assign by the default value of array data type.");  
       $display (" %0p", stat_arr.a);  
       void '(stat_arr.randomize ());  
       $display ("After randomize the elements of array 'a'");  
       $display ("Output =  %0p ",stat_arr.a);   
       end  
     
Above code, declared an array 'a[5]' of byte data type. The randomization is done by using the randomization function. Without using void, after compilation, the compiler displays a warning.  Here, after the randomization of the class, the randomized array will be displayed.

* **Example -2**-  
The below example shows the randomization of a two-dimensional static array without using constraint. 

      class class_1;  
      rand bit [3:0]a[2][4];  
      endclass  
      module mod;  
      class_1 pack;  
      initial begin  
      pack = new;  
      $display ("The value elements of array before randomization = %0p",pack.a);  
      for (int i =0;i<=5;i++)begin  
      void'(pack.randomize());  
      $display ("The value of elements of array after randomization = %0p",pack.a);  
      end
      end   

Above code, the array declared is a[2][4] with each element of size 4 bits. Inside the module, for loop is used to get more iterations.

      class class_1;  
      rand bit [4:0]a[2:0][3:0];  
      constraint b{foreach (a[i,j])    // standard way to represent multidimensional array using  
                     a[i][j]<12;}           //foreach conditional statement  
       endclass  
       module mod;  
       class_1 pack;  
       initial begin  
         $display ("Randomization of multidimensional array");  
         $display ("----------------------------------------");  
        pack=new();  
        $display ("Before randomization");  
        $display (" Array = %0p",pack.a); // gives default value of data types .  
        $display ("After randomization");  
        void'(pack.randomize());  
        for (int i =0;i<=5;i++)begin  
        void'(pack.randomize());  
        $display (" Iteration = %0d, Array = %0p",i,pack.a);   
        end

### Dynamic Array  
A dynamic array has no predefined size during array declaration. Generally, the array_name.new() keyword is used to assign the size of the dynamic array.  
Constraints are used in two ways -    
1. To limit the size of the dynamic array by using the keyword size in the constraint block.  
2. To give the value using operators for the elements of the dynamic array using "foreach" conditional statement in the constraint block.     
The below example will show how to randomize the dynamic array.

The output after randomization is an empty array if the size is not constrained.  

* **Example**    
  
      class class_1;  
       randc bit [7:0] dyn_arr[];  
       // declaring a dynamic array, each element is of 8 bits.  
       constraint dyn_arr_size{dyn_arr.size()>3;dyn_arr.size()<7;}  
       // declare the size of the dyn_arr between 3 to 7
       constraint dyn_arr_ele{foreach (dyn_arr[i])   // each element value is square of the index number.  
                             dyn_arr[i]==i*i;}  
       endclass  
       module mod;  
       class_1 pack;  
       initial begin  
       pack = new();  
       void'(pack.randomize());  
       for (int i = 0;i<pack.dyn_arr.size();i++)begin  
      $display ("Iteration =%0p Value =%0p",i,pack.dyn_arr[i]);  
      end  
      end  

Above code, first declaring a dynamic array 'dyn_arr[]'. Inside class declaring a constraint for giving the size range. Inside the module, randomize() function is used to randomize the class. The size of the array is between 3 to 7 using constraint. The output will be displayed after randomization for (size of array +1) times.

# Inside constraint
The inside keyword is used to check if a given value lies within the range.
The values contained by the inside block can be variable, constant, or range. **inside** construct includes both upper and lower limits and it gathers all values and chooses between the values with equal probability.    
In the inside block, we write inside keyword followed by curly braces{}

* **Syntax**
 
 `constraint const_name { variable inside { values or range };}`

 * **Example:**     
Let's take an example of inside constraint for better understanding.

              // class declaration
              class PQR;
              // random variable declared using the rand keyword
              rand bit [3:0] var1;
              //constraint block
              constraint C1 {(var1 inside {[3:9]});}
              endclass

              module top;
              initial begin
              int i;
              //Here, we need to create a handle
              //handle name is pkt
              PQR pqr;
              //memory allocation to the handle
              pqr=new();
              $display("-------Output for  inside constraint-------");
              $display("-------------------------------------------");
              for(int i =1; i<7;i++)begin
              // The .randomize() function is used to randomize properties of an object of a class
              void'(pqr.randomize());
              $display("[%0t] @ iteration: %0d -----> var1=%0d",$time,i,pqr.var1);
              end
              $display("-------------------------------------------");
              end
              endmodule

In the above example, we declared a class, the class name is PQR in which variable var1 is declared. In the constraint block, we are declaring a range by the use of an inside keyword and the range lies between 3 and 9.      
In this, the random value will be printed between the 3 and 9.

# Inverted inside constraint

The inverted inside is the opposite of the inside operator. It can be achieved by just placing a not symbol **!** before it.    
If we want to generate a value that should not be inside a range of values (range_of_values), here we can use the inside operator with negation

* **Syntax**    
` constraint const_name { !(variable inside { values or range });}`

* **Example:**      
Let's take an example of  invert inside constraint for better understanding.

              // class declaration
              class PQR;
              // random variable declared using the rand keyword
              rand bit [3:0] var2;
              //constraint block
              //here we use, not symbol before the inside keyword
              constraint C1 {!(var2 inside {[3:9]});}
              endclass
              module top;
              initial begin
              int i;
              //Here, we need to create a handle
              //handle name is pkt
              PQR pqr;
             //memory allocation to the handle
             pqr=new();
             $display("-----Output for invert inside constraint-----");
             $display("---------------------------------------------");
             for(int i =1; i<7;i++)
             begin
             // The .randomize() function is used to randomize properties of an object of a class
             void'(pqr.randomize());
             $display("[%0t] @ iteration: %0d -----> var2=%0d",$time,i,pqr.var2);
             end
             $display("---------------------------------------------");
             end
             endmodule

In the above example, we declared a class, the class name is PQR in which variable var2 is declared. In the constraint block, we are declaring a range by the use of an inside keyword with the negation and the range lies between 3 and 9. If we want to generate a value that should not be inside a range of values, here we can use the inside operator with negation.      
In this, the random value will be printed that does not lie in range because of use of inside keyword with negation.
     

* **Output snap:**    
The below figure shows the output of the inverted inside constraint.

# Weighted Distribution
The dist operator allows you to create the weighted distribution. **dist** is an operator that takes a list of values and weights, separated by **:=** or 
 **:/** operator.
The value which is more weight, the occurrence of that value in randomization is more. The **dist** operator is helpful whenever to have weighted distribution during randomization. 

There are two types of distribution operators

## 1.  := operator
The := operator assigns the specified weight to the item or, if the item is a range, specified value to every value in the range. 

* **Syntax**

`value := weightage`

 * **Example:**      
              Let's take an example := operator for better understanding.

            class myWorld;
            // random variable declared using the rand keyword
            rand bit [3:0] value1;
            //constraint block
            //In this, the weight of 1 is 30, 6 is 70, and 7 is 20
            //while 2 through 5 is 40
    
            constraint m_var { value1 dist { 1:=30, [2:5]:=40, 6:=70, 7:=20};}
            endclass
 
             module top;
             initial begin
             int i;
            //Here, we need to create a handle
            //handle name is world
             myWorld world;
            // memory allocation to the handle
            world = new();
            $display("-----Output for := operator-----");
            $display("The occurrence of '6' is more as '6' has more weight");
            for(int i =0; i<10; i++) begin
            void'( world.randomize());
            $display("[%0t] @ iteration %0d  -----> value1=%0d",$time,i,world.value1);
            end
            end
           endmodule

In this example, the weight of 1 is 30, 6 is 70, and 7 is 20  while 2 through 5 is 40, for a total of 280.   
Hence the probability of choosing 1 is 30/280, 6 is 70/280, 7 is 20/280 and the probability of choosing a value between 2 and 5 is 40/280. In this 6 have appeared more because they have a higher weight and are chosen more often.

## 2. :/ operator

The :/ operator assigns the specified weight to the item or,  if the item is a range,  to the range as a whole. If there are n values in the range, the weight of each value is range_weight / n

* **Syntax**

` value :/ weightage`

 * **Example**      
Let's take an example of :/ operator for better understanding.

             //class declaration
             class myWorld;
             //random variable declared using the rand keyword
             rand bit [3:0] value1;
             //constraint block
             //In this, the weight of 1 is 30, 6 is 40, and 7 is 20
             //while 2 through 5 share a total weight of 60
             constraint m_var { value1 dist { 1:/30, [2:5]:/60, 6:/40, 7:/20};} 
             endclass
             //module name is top
             module top;
             initial begin
             int i;
             //Here, we need to create a handle
             //handle name is world
             myWorld world;
 
             //memory allocation to the handle
             world = new();
             $display("-----Output for :/ operator");
             $display(" The occurrence of '6' is more as '6' has more weight");
             $display("--------------------------------");
             for(int i =0; i<10; i++) begin
             void'( world.randomize());
             $display("[%0t] @ iteration %0d -----> value1=%0d",$time,i,world.value1);
             end
             end
             endmodule


In this example, the weight of 1 is 30, 6 is 40, and 7 is 20, while 2 through 5 share a total weight of 60, thus having 60/4 each.  
Hence the probability of choosing 1 is 30/150, 6 is 40/150,  7 is 20/150 and the probability of choosing a value between 2 and 5 is 60/150.    
In this, 6 has appeared more than the other because it has the highest weight.

The below figure shows the output of the weighted distribution with :/ operator.

### Bidirectional constraint     
Constraints are solved bidirectionally, which means constraints on all random variables will be solved parallel.    
Constraints solve parallelly for all random variables and make sure no constraint fails.

* **Example:**      
Let's take an example of bidirectional constraint for better understanding.

              //class declaration
              class items;
              // random variable declared by using rand keyword
              rand bit [3:0] value1;
              //constraint block
              constraint addr_mode1 { value1 > 5;
                         value1 <12;}
              constraint addr_mode2 {value1>6;}
              endclass
              // module name is constraint_top
              module constraint_top;
               initial begin
              int i;
             //Here, we need to create a handle
             //handle name is an item
             items  item;
             //memory allocation to the handle
             item = new();
             $display(" -----Output for bidirectional constraint-----");
             $display(" -----constraint 1 & 2 limits the value to 7,8,9,10 and 11-----");
             $display("----------------------------------------------------------------");
             for (int i =1;i<10;i++) begin
             void'(item.randomize());
            $display("[%0t] @ iteration %0d -----> value1 = %0d",$time, i, item.value1);
            end
            $display("----------------------------------------------------------------");
            end
            endmodule
       
In the above example, we declared a class, the class name is item in which variable value1 is declared. In the constraint blocks, we are giving some conditions in both constraints. Constraints on all random variables will be solved parallel.  
In this, constraint 1 & 2 limits the value to 7,8,9,10 and 11.

The below figure shows the output of the bidirectional constraint.

# Implication Constraint

The implication operator is used to declare the conditional relations between two variables. The implication operator is placed between the expression and constraint

implication operator is denoted by the symbol **->**   

## Implication operator 

The implication operator **->** is used in a constraint expression to show the conditional relationship between two variables. The implication operator is placed between the expression and constraint.

If the expression on the LHS of implication operator **->** is true, then the constraint expression on the RHS will be satisfied. If the LHS is not true, then the RHS expression is not considered.

* **Syntax:**        
`constraint const_name { (variable1) -> (variable2) }`

 * **Example:**       
           Let's take an example of an implication operator for better understanding.  
  
             //class declaration
            class ABC;
            // random variable declared using rand keyword
            rand bit [2:0] value1;
            rand bit [3:0] value2;
            //constraint block
            //implication operator is used to mention conditions between
            //two variables value1 and value2
            constraint c_mode { (value1 inside {[1:5]}) -> (value2 <8);}
            endclass
            // module name is top
            module top;
            initial begin
            int i;
            //Here, we need to declare a handle
            //handle name is abc
            ABC abc;
            // memory allocation to the handle
            abc = new();
            $display("-----Output for implication constraint-----");
            $display("-------------------------------------------");
            for(int i = 0; i< 10 ; i++) begin
            void'(abc.randomize());
            $display("[%0t] @ iteration %0d -----> value1=%0d , value2=%0d" ,$time,i, abc.value1, abc.value2);
            end
            $display("--------------------------------------------");
            end
            endmodule

In the above example, we declared a class, class name is ABC in which two variables value1 and value2 are declared. In the constraint block, value1 has declared the range by using the inside keyword.        
In this, if the value1 lies between the range of 1 and 5 then the value2 is always less than 8.    
If the value1 does not lie between the range of 1 and 5 then the value2 is always greater than 8.

## if-else Constraint
 The **if-else**  block allows conditional execution of constraint. If the expression is true, all the constraints in the first constraint-block must be satisfied, otherwise, all the constraints in the optional else constraint must be satisfied.  


 * **Example:**      
Let's take an example of the if-else constraint for better understanding.

             // class declaration
             class basic;
             //value1 & value2 are the variables
             //random variables are created by rand keyword
             rand bit [3:0] value1;
             rand bit [2:0] value2;
             constraint c_var {
                              if(value1 inside {[4'h3:4'h9]})
                               value2 == 1;
                             else {
                                   value2 == 0;}
                            }
             endclass
             //module name is top
             module top;
             int i=1;
             initial begin
             //here, we need to create a handle
             //handle name is pkt
             basic pkt;
            // memory allocation to the handle
            pkt = new();
            $display("-----Output for if else constraint-----");
            $display("If the value1 lies between the 3 to 9, ");
            $display(" then value2 will be 1 otherwise 0 ");
            $display("-----------------------------------------------");
            for (int i=0;i<5;i++)begin
            void'( pkt.randomize());
            $display("[%0t] @ iteration %0d ----->  value1=%0d, value2 = %0d",$time,i,pkt.value1,pkt.value2);
            end
            $display("-----------------------------------------------");
            end
            endmodule

In the above example,  we declared a class, class name is basic in which two variables value1 and value2 are declared. In the constraint block, we are using the if-else condition.   
In the if statement, the value1 has declared a range with the use of the inside keyword, and if the range lies between 3 and 9 then the value2 will always be 1 and if the range does not lie between the range of 3 and 9 then the value2 always be 0.

### foreach constraint    
 
The foreach constructs iterate over the elements of an array and assign all the values of each element to that of its index.      
The foreach loop iterates over the elements of an array, so constraints with the foreach loop are called Iterative constraints

 * **Syntax:**      
`constraint constraint_name { foreach ( variable[iterator] )  variable[iterator] <..conditions..>  }`

* **Example:**      
Let's take an example of foreach constraint for better understanding.

               //class declaration
               class value;
               //random variable declared using rand keyword 
               rand bit [3:0] s_array1[4];
               rand bit [3:0] s_array2[5];
               //constraint block
               //standard way to represent fixed array using  
               //foreach conditional statement  
               constraint cons {foreach(s_array1[i])
                                 s_array1[i]==i;
                                foreach (s_array2[i])
                                  s_array2[i] == i;}
               endclass
               // module name is top
               module top;
               initial begin
               //here,we need to declare handle
               //handle name is val
               value val;
              //memory allocation to the handle
              val = new();
              $display("-------------------------------");
              void'(val.randomize());
              $display("\t s_array1=%0p" , val.s_array1);
              $display("\t s_array2=%0p" , val.s_array2);
              $display("-------------------------------");
              end
              endmdule

In the above example, we declared a class and the class name is value in which two fixed arrays are defined.    
two arrays s_array1 and s_array2 are declared inside the class.  This constraint will iterate through each of the elements in an array,
and set each element to the value of its particular index

The below figure shows the output of the foreach constraint.
